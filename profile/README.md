## Our Technique
At Vedius Arcade Studios, we believe in the transformative power of gaming. 
Our approach is rooted in a deep understanding of the nostalgic essence and joy of classic gaming, combined with modern innovation. 
We work closely with our clients to tap into this spirit, creating games that resonate deeply with their audiences.

Through collaborative storytelling and interactive design, we craft unique user experiences that tell compelling stories. 
Each game we develop is more than just a product; it's a journey that connects players with the core of gaming - fun, engagement, and unforgettable experiences. 
This connection is our secret to creating games that not only entertain but also form lasting memories and emotional bonds with players.

## Our Tech

At Vedius Arcade Studios, we harness the power of DragonRuby Game Toolkit, a game-changer in the realm of game development. 
Compact yet mighty, this professional-grade 2D engine is a mere ~3.5MB, ensuring swift performance across platforms, including consoles and mobile. 
Its simplicity lies in a custom multi-level runtime that eliminates the need for external installers or OS-level prerequisites, paired with highly optimized C code for unparallelled speed. 
DragonRuby boasts cross-platform compatibility (PC, Mac, Linux, Web Assembly, iOS, Android, and major consoles) and features dirt-simple APIs for creating intricate 2D games. 
With hot-loaded code, real-time changes, and instant feedback, DragonRuby enables us to focus on innovation and creativity, making game development a breeze
